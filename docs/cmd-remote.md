`sfcc remote`

> Connect to SFCC CLI via Browser Extension

![demo](https://sfcc-cli.s3.amazonaws.com/remote.gif)


Browser Extension Setup
---

To get started, you'll need to [Install the Browser Extension](https://github.com/redvanworkshop/sfcc-remote).

Once you have the browser extension installed, you will need to do the following:

```bash
sfcc remote
```

Once the remote is turned on, all your `sfcc log` and `sfcc watch` output will be pushed to the browser extension.

SSL Certificates
---

In order for the SSL certificates to work locally, you will need to add the certificate to your system keys.

<p>

For MacOS you can do this:

```bash
cd ./remote/ssl
sudo security add-trusted-cert -d -r trustRoot -k /Library/Keychains/System.keychain sfcc-cli-ca.cer
```

SSL Certs already created in `./remote/ssl`, but if they need to be created again, here is how it was done:

```bash
cd ./remote/ssl
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -out sfcc-cli-ca.cer -outform PEM -keyout sfcc-cli-ca.pvk -days 10000 -verbose -config sfcc-cli.cnf -nodes -sha256 -subj "/CN=sfcc-cli CA"
openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout sfcc-cli-localhost.pvk -out sfcc-cli-localhost.req -subj /CN=localhost -sha256 -nodes
openssl x509 -req -CA sfcc-cli-ca.cer -CAkey sfcc-cli-ca.pvk -in sfcc-cli-localhost.req -out sfcc-cli-localhost.cer -days 10000 -extfile sfcc-cli.ext -sha256 -set_serial 0x1111
```
