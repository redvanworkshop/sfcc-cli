#### Invalid Domain Certificates

For `sfcc-cli` commands that initiate network requests, you may get an error similar to the following:

``Error [ERR_TLS_CERT_ALTNAME_INVALID]: Hostname/IP does not match certificate's altnames: Host: dev09.commerce.myclient.demandware.net. is not in the cert's altnames: DNS:*.demandware.net, DNS:demandware.net``

This is because node cannot verify that the server is valid according to the TLS certificate.  The following command executed in your terminal will temporarily disable this check while you have your terminal session open.

#### Mac and Linux

```bash
export NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0
```

#### Windows

```bash
set NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0
```
